# Areas of Improvement for MiniFyn

## 1. Test Coverage

- Implement unit tests for critical functions using a testing framework like Jest
- Add integration tests for API routes
- Set up end-to-end tests using a tool like Cypress or Playwright
- Aim for at least 80% test coverage
- Integrate tests into the CI/CD pipeline

## 2. Error Handling

- Implement a consistent error handling strategy across the application
- Create custom error classes for different types of errors (e.g., ValidationError, DatabaseError)
- Use try-catch blocks in async functions, especially in API routes
- Implement global error handling middleware for Express
- Log errors with appropriate severity levels
- Return user-friendly error messages while logging detailed errors server-side

## 4. Security Enhancements

- Implement helmet.js for setting secure HTTP headers
- Add rate limiting on authentication endpoints to prevent brute force attacks
- Use bcrypt for password hashing (if not already implemented)
- Implement CSRF protection using a library like csurf
- Regular dependency updates to patch security vulnerabilities
- Implement input validation and sanitization on all user inputs
- Use parameterized queries for database operations to prevent SQL injection

## 5. Accessibility

- Conduct an accessibility audit using tools like axe-core
- Ensure proper use of ARIA attributes where necessary
- Use semantic HTML elements appropriately
- Implement keyboard navigation support
- Ensure sufficient color contrast for text and interactive elements
- Provide alternative text for images and icons
- Test with screen readers and other assistive technologies

## 6. Performance Monitoring

- Implement application performance monitoring (APM) using a tool like New Relic or Datadog
- Set up real user monitoring (RUM) to track actual user experiences
- Monitor and optimize database query performance
- Implement logging for critical operations and errors
- Set up alerts for performance thresholds and error rates
- Regularly review and optimize slow API endpoints
- Implement caching strategies where appropriate (e.g., Redis for frequently accessed data)
- Set up monitoring for third-party service dependencies (e.g., PayU integration)

Remember to prioritize these improvements based on their impact and the current stage of your project. Regularly revisit and update this list as the project evolves.
